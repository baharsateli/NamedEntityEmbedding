# Named Entity Embedding

This is a sample project on learning word embeddings of Named Entities from textual content. The assumption here is that the input corpus is composed of a sequence of named entities (e.g., using their labels from the DBpedia ontology) rather than raw text.

The implementation is based on the DL4J library. :warning: This project is still under active development.
